==============================================================================

*) Where to install the SuperVpMaxMsp files

Ircam SuperVP is a package for Max/MSP.
The recommended installation procedure consists in copying the "SuperVPMaxMSP" folder (from the dmg disk image) to your "Max Package folder".
Your "Max Package folder" is typically located in your "Documents" folder, more specifically :
"~/Documents/Max 8/Packages" if you are using Max 8
"~/Documents/Max 7/Packages" if you are using Max 7

In case you use both Max 7 and Max 8, you might want to copy the "SuperVPMaxMSP" folder in each of the Max Package folders.

*) Quarantine on macOS 10.15 Catalina

If you are using macOS 10.15 Catalina, it is possible that the downloaded "SuperVPMaxMSP" files have been "quarantined" by the OS.
As the result, the supervp external objets wouldn't load in Max.
To avoid this issue, you need to remove the quarantine. To do so, you need to open the Terminal application, and execute the following command :

xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine [path/to/extern/directory]

Examples :
xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine "~/Documents/Max 8/Packages/SuperVPMaxMSP"
xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine "~/Documents/Max 7/Packages/SuperVPMaxMSP"

Once you have removed the quarantine, you can start Max, and SuperVPMaxMSP external objects should work properly.
